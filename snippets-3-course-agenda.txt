Ruby Methods

Naming conventions: method_one, method_two

Definition: 

def method_one
  statement-1
  statement-2
  statement-3
end


Ruby is an object oriented programming lanugagues. It's an interepreted language.

Statement: In ruby everything is an object and there are no primitives.

Primitives are int, char, str, float

int i
char c
float f
string s

Let's interpret deeper
1. If integer(5) is an object, what's it class? or Parent?
Ans: 5 is an integer object, whose class is Fixnum.
2. Let's say there is a class! what are the methods implemented?
Ans: For integer objects 130 methods are implemented
3. Let's say methods are implemented! how to use these methods?
Ans: 5.next


What next?
Ans: Try more methods as per http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Fixnum.html

Statement: Operators are nothing but methods in Ruby
 +, -, *, /, %, =, ==

5 + 5 => 5.+(5)

1. If they are methods, how or where are they defined?
Ans: Yes they are methods. Definition of each of them are available within class
     	http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Fixnum.html#method-i-2A
	http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-2A
2. Show/Try examples
Ans:
	5.+(10) => 15
	"ruby "*5 => "ruby ruby ruby ruby ruby " 




Method invocation by object -> <object>.<method-name>

Kernel method "class" which is accessible by all objects. <object>.class
Kernel method "methods" which is accessible by all objects. <object>.methods

			Numeric Class
	--------------------------------------------------
	|		|		|
   Fixnum             Bignum      	Float

class
	methods
	new
object = ClassName.new

int var-name = "value"

Object Oriented Programming
	Abstraction - To abstract the requirement
	Encapsulation - 
	Inheritence - Ability of child to inherit the properties/behavior that a parent class implements
	Polymorpshism - Overloading & Overriding
